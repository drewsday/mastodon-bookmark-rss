# mastodon-bookmark-rss

A small app to let you connect your mastodon bookmarks to your RSS reader.

Use the instance at [woodland.cafe](https://bookmark-rss.services.woodland.cafe), or run your own using [pre-built docker images](https://github.com/untitaker/mastodon-bookmark-rss/pkgs/container/mastodon-bookmark-rss).

# Running it locally

1. Clone this repository
2. Have Rust, Node and Yarn installed. I recommend [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
   for Rust and [Volta](https://volta.sh/) for installing both Node and Yarn.
3. Install [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/)
4. Run `yarn dev` to get a devserver at `localhost:3000`
